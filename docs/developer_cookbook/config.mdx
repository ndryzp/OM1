title: Build a fresh config file
description: "Config"
---

The config file defines the agent that runs on your machine.
It tells OM1 which modules to load, how the robot should behave, and which modes are available.

To ensure your configuration is valid, follow the format defined [here](https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1/tree/main/config/schema).

OpenMind supports two configuration schemas:

1. Single-Mode Schema

Use this when your robot only needs to run one dedicated mode. For example, a pure conversation agent or a navigation-only setup.
The entire agent is optimized around a single use case.

2. Multi-Mode Schema

Use this when you want the robot to switch between multiple modes at runtime based on user choice or context.
You can configure any subset of the available five modes, just two, or all five, depending on your application.

### Steps to build a new config file

1. Start with getting your API key from [OpenMind Portal](https://portal.openmind.org/). Copy it and save it, you'll paste it into the config later.
2. Create a new config file config.json5

    #### **version** *string* — Required

    The version of the configuration format.

    **Example: "v1.0.0"**

    #### **hertz** *number* — Required

    How often (in Hz) the agent runs its update loop.

    **Example: 0.01**

    #### **name** *string* — Required

    The name of the agent.

    **Example: "conversation"**

    #### **api_key** *string* — Required

    API key used to authenticate the agent.

    **Example: "openmind_free"**

    #### **system_prompt_base** *string* — Required

    Defines the agent’s core personality and behavior.

    This serves as the primary system prompt for the LLM.

    #### **system_governance** *string* — Required

    The laws or constraints that the agent must follow during operation.

    Modeled similarly to Asimov’s laws.

    #### **system_prompt_examples** *string* — Optional
    Example interactions that help guide the model’s behavior.

3. Customize the system prompts

    There are three key prompt fields:

    - system_prompt_base

        Defines your agent’s personality and behavior.
        You can keep the “Spot the dog” behavior or edit it to match your needs. You can also provide context to the LLM here.

    - system_governance

        Hard-coded rules the agent must follow (Asimovs laws).

    - system_prompt_examples

        Give your model examples of how to respond.
        These help shape its responses.
        You can add more examples if needed.

4. Configure inputs
    Inputs provide the sensory capabilities that allow robots to perceive their environment

    #### **agent_inputs** *array* — Required

    List of input sources or data types the agent can accept in this mode. Each item in the array is an object with the following properties:

    #### **type** *string* — Required

    The input type identifier.

    **Example: "AudioInput"**

    #### **config** *object* — Optional

    Configuration options specific to this input type.

    **Example: GoogleASRInput**

5. Configure the LLM
    #### **cortex_llm** *object* — Required

    Configures the Cortex LLM behavior.

    #### **type** *string* — Required

    The LLM provider name.

    **Example: "OpenAILLM"**

    #### **config** *object* — Optional

    Agent name used in metadata

    #### **agent_name** *string* — Optional

    Agent name used in metadata

    **Example: "Spot"**

    ### **history_length** *integer* — Optional

    Number of past messages to remember in the conversation.

    **Example: "10"**

6. Set up agent actions

    Actions define what your agent can do. You can define movement, TTS or any other actions here.

    #### **agent_actions** *Array* — Required

    Defines actions the agent can execute.

    #### **name** *string* — Required

    Human-readable identifier for the action.

    **Example: "speak"**

    #### **llm_label** *string* — Required

    Label the model uses to refer to this action.

    **Example: "speak"**

    #### **implementation** *string* — Optional

    This defines the business logic, if any. If there's none defined, we use default value `passthough`.

    **Example: "passthrough"**

    #### **connector** *string* — Required

    Name of the connector. This field is the python file name defined under `actions/action_name/connector`.

    **Example: "elevenlabs_tts"**

7. Validate the config

    Before using the file: Check for JSON errors, make sure commas, quotes, and braces are correct and confirm that correct API key is configured.
